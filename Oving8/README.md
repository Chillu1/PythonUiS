## Task 8

I didn't follow all the "rules" & point list on this task. Instead, I implemented harder but more compact solutions.
Like: Enum for ship types, one list of all positions that hold all info we need (is_shot, placed_ship, etc).
In my opinion it's a better because the code will be easier to mantain and expand upon. Granted, with extra complexity.

I also used some more complex functions & solutions to learn Python more in-depth.
